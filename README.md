Employee Attrition Prediction (The "HRM & Analytics" Hybrid)
The Problem: HR wants to know which employees are likely to leave the company (churn) so they can intervene with retention offers.
Data: Used the popular "IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition" dataset (available on Kaggle). It contains fields like Age, JobSatisfaction, YearsAtCompany, OverTime, and Attrition (Yes/No).
Analysis (Classification):
Algorithms: linear regression, random forest, logistic regression
Build a model to predict the target variable (Attrition)
Identify key drivers: Does "overtime" or "low monthly income" drive people away?
